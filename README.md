## Introduction
A project made with the Raylib library, simulating snowflakes particles. This was developed in the midst of my study in video game programming at College of Bois-de-Boulogne. This is one of the project made within the "Advanced programming" course (session 4 of 5).

## F.A.Q.

> What is the game engine used?
- Raylib library

> What is the development period?
- From November 7th 2022 to November 21th 2022 [14 days period]

## Controls
- Arrows (up/down/left/right): move/jump/tilt the character
- Space bar: jump
- Numbers 1 to 9: restarts the simulation with a predefined number of particles

## Credits
- [EpsilonsQc](https://github.com/EpsilonsQc) - various optimizations to improve performance (profiling, object size), object pool implementation
- Snowflakes simulation, based on code from **Khalil Hajlaoui**
